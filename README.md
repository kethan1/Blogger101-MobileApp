## Startup Guide

### Changes to Code

If you want to run this with a local copy of the Blogger101 website (for the API, instead of the actual API), checkout this repo: https://github.com/kethan1/blogger101-website. Download the repo and unzip the folder. Follow the instructions in the readme and get a local instance of the website up and running. Then, download and go through the code for this repo (mobile app), and replace `https://blogger101.com/` with your local website url (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/` if you didn't change the code).

### Setup

Make sure you have nodejs and npm installed. Then, download this repo.

Install the Dependencies:

```
npm install
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then, run `expo start` in the project folder. The app is up and running!
